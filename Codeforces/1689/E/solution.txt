    Increasing all 0s to 1s always gives optimal answer. It takes C 
    Then calculate the addition X.
    Create a graph between bits
    If graph is already connected then X = 0
    else X is at most 2
    *Prove:
        + Find maximum lower bit : a(i) & -a(i) = k, 
        and numbers have lower bit = k: x1, x2,...xm;
        ......
          ^
          k
        1. m = 1
        + Subtract 1 from x1, the binary form should be:
            11111110...
            .......k...
        As k is maximum among all the lower bits then
        for any j, such a(j) & -a(j) < k -> j is connected to x1. Thus, X costs 1
        to make the graph connected 
        2. m >= 2
        We apply the same to x1 but we might disconnect 
        other j, such a(j) & -a(j) == k 
        Thus, we have to:
        + Add 1 to x2, the binary form is:
            10000001..
            .......k..
        By doing so, X costs 2 in this case
        Overall, it takes C + X
